Changes in 0.9.0:
 * protocol versioning is much more granular now allowing for backwards
   compatible versions of functions
 * changeset command now generates changesets for multiple troves spread
   across multiple repositories
 * change sets are transferred as a set of independent change sets now
   (laying the groundwork for repository change set caching, with which
   this version will work just fine)

Changes in 0.8.3:
 * Man page updates.
 * The "conary query" command now accepts multiple arguments for
   troves and paths
 * Fixed "conary erase" command which was broken in 0.8.2

Changes in 0.8.2:
 * You can now install multiple troves at once (even a combination of
   changeset files and troves from repositories), and the entire
   action is recorded in a single rollback (this required a change in
   command-line arguments for updating troves). 
 * The beginnings of support for searching multiple repositories 
 * Miscellaneous code cleanup and bug fixes.

Changes in 0.8.1:
 * The source code has been re-arranged for easier maintenance, and
   conary has been split into two programs: conary and cvc.
 * Better error messages and debugging tracebacks

Changes in 0.8.0:
 * A new changeset format supports hard links but requires staged update.
 * The new changeset format also collapses duplicate contents even
   when hardlinks are not used.
 * By default, rc?.d/{K,S}* symlinks are no longer packaged. The
   chkconfig program is relied on to create them at package
   install/update time. Init scripts are explicitly required to
   support the chkconfig protocol by default
 * Improved error messages
 * Several bug fixes.

Changes in 0.7.7:
 * Extended debugger saves and emails
 * Tracebacks now include arguments and locals
 * More size optimizations were made when applying changesets
 * Applying absolute changesets when a trove is already installed is
   now much more efficient than it was
 * Self-referential symlinks raise a packaging exception.
 * Several bugs fixes.

Changes in 0.7.6:
 * Installation
   * Hardlink handling
   * enhanced debugging capabilities (including saving a debugging
     state file to enable remote debugging)

   * using binary file ids and iterators for significant memory savings
   * and runtime support for the x86.x86_64 sub-architecture
 * Cooking
   * more robust handling of the --resume option
   * policy normalization of where app-defaults files go.

Changes in 0.7.5:
 * Hard links are implemented (but not yet enabled, in order to
   preserve changeset compatibility for now).
 * Several bugs have been fixed for installing and cooking.

Changes in 0.7.4:
 * Fileids are now stored and transmitted in binary rather than
   encoded.
 * Better handling of multiple versions of packages/troves installed
   at the same time
 * Missing file handling improvements
 * Recipe inheritance is now possible between repositories
 * Enhanced Interrupted builds
 * The dynamic tag protocol was slightly modified
 * Added Arch.x86.amd64 and Arch.x86.em64t
 * several bugs fixes

Changes in 0.7.0:
 * sqlite3 is used for the database
 * better handling of multiple packages with the same name installed at once.

Changes in 0.6.6:
 * repository protocol update
 * changeset format update
 * added the ability to resume halted local builds
 * added the ability to easily package build-time tests to run at
   install time to qualify new/changed environments
 * better handling of packaged .pyc/.pyo files
 * better shared library handling
 * improved inline documentation
 * optimizations for both space and time
 * numerous bugfixes
