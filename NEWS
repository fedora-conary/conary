Changes in 0.12.2
  * added getTroveVersionsByBranch
  * make better use of _mergeQueryResults
  * moved version affinity into findTrove from ConaryClient
  * fixed branch affinity so that it's actually branch affinity instead of
    label affinity
  * rdiff changes for 0.12.0 broke negative numbers for oldVersion
  * rdiff diff'd based on label instead of branch
  * update has flavor affinity now
  * flavors can now be specified on the command line for update
  * unspecified flavor flags got scores of zero, which was wrong
  * added python code for flavor scoring (useful for the client)

Changes in 0.12.1
  * repquery and query always showed dependency information
  * getTroveLeavesByBranch did extra demarshalling of the flavor
  * repquery didn't deal with nonexistant troves well
  * dependency failures on erase didn't reassemble dependency flags properly
  * fixed bug in dependency sets creation which caused dependency flags
    to get mangled
  * added a check to prevent mangled flags from getting committed

Changes in 0.12.0
  * document config command, and display supplied macro/use/arch information 
    in output
  * repository acl's work for almost everything
  * anonymous access must be explicitly enabled by creating an acl for
    user 'anonymous' with password 'anonymous'
  * server side flavor scoring used
  * queries reworked for flavor matching

Changes in 0.11.10.1
  * move to python2.4
  * repository caching (which isn't used yet) didn't track the recurse flag

Changes in 0.11.10
  * changed flavor tracking when loadRecipe() is used to only track
    flavors in loaded recipes that are superclasses of the recipe
    class in the loading recipe.  (e.g. loading python.recipe to get
    the distribution python version will not add all of the python
    recipe's flavor information to the loading recipe class, as long
    as the loading recipe does not subclass the Python class.)
  * add conary verify command for comparing the local system's state to 
    the state it was in at install time
  * when a trove is installed for the first time, it comes from a single
    repository
  * didn't handle file types changing on update
  * fixed problem assigning depNums
  * components disappearing from troves caused problems in relative changesets
  * files moving from removed troves in changesets caused update to fail

Changes in 0.11.9
  * change the order of permissions setting (chmod after chown)
    because some versions of the Linux kernel remove setuid/gid bits
    when setting ownership to root

Changes in 0.11.8
  * work around a python bug w/ fdopen() resetting file permissions
  * r.Replace() as an alternative to r.Run("sed -i '...' file")
  * Policy enforcing UTF-8 filenames
  * r.macros.tagdatadir as a standard place to put data just for taghandlers

Changes in 0.11.7
  * changed server.py to take extra config files via --config-file instead
    of as an extra argument
  * extra config files (specified with --config-file) were ignored if they
    didn't exist; issue an error message now
  * Added r.ConsoleHelper() for recipes
  * PAM configuration files shouldn't have paths to modules by default,
    so we remove what used to be the standard path
  * changed repository user authentication to use user groups (currently 
    one per user)
  * added password salt
  * restructured repository a bit
  * removed lots of unused code from FilesystemRepository 

Changes in 0.11.6
  * branches are created as changesets now instead of as a protocol call
  * merged authdb into primary repository
  * fix for rdiff (broken by flavor rework in 0.11.5)

Changes in 0.11.5
  * Internals reworked to eliminate flavor of None in favor of empty flavor
  * Added (currently unused) code to parse command line flavor specifications
  * static libraries (.a files) get proper flavors now
  * Handle attempts to update already installed troves from absolute 
    change sets

Changes in 0.11.4
  * all components built from a single recipe share a common flavor
  * loadRecipe's label= keyword argument can actually take a label
    as well as a hostname

Changes in 0.11.3:
  * optimized a sqlite update statement to use indexed columns
  * added --test to update and erase
  * dependency check didn't handle new components providing the same
    items as old components (broken by 0.11.1 performance enhancements)

Changes in 0.11.2:
  * standalone server was broken by --add-user changes in 0.11.1
  * dependency check no longer allows packages being removed to cause
    dependency failures
  * changed how dependencies are frozen to make the order deterministic
    (so fileId's don't change around)
  * added a database version to the database schema

Changes in 0.11.1:
  * erasing troves enforces dependencies -- this requires a database 
    conversion (run the conary-add-filedeps script which fixed the
    conversion to 0.11.0 after updating conary)
  * reworked dependency queries to take advantage of indices for much
    better performance
  * add --add-user to server.py for creating the authdb

Changes in 0.11.0:
  * massive rework of fileId mechanism to allow better flavor support
  * added columns to dependency tables to allow erase dependency checks
    (which are not yet implemented)
  * enabled trove requirements
  * added cvcdesc and the 'describe' command to cvc to generate
    and use metadata XML files.
  * getMetadata follows the branch structure up until it finds metadata
    for the trove.
  * changed getFileContents() to not need trove name or trove version
  * byte-compiled emacs lisp files are transient, like python
    byte-compiled files
  * addSource recipe action now can take a mode= keyword argument
  * cook now enforces having no dash characters in version numbers
  * files are explicitly disallowed from depending on groups, packages,
    or filesets; the only trove dependency that a file or component
    can have is on a component.  Only filesets can depend on filesets.
 
Changes in 0.10.11:
  * reworked how absolute change sets get converted to relative change
    sets for better efficiency
  * chained dependency resolution caused duplicate troves in the final
    changeset (and a lot of extra work)
  * added --config to stand alone repository
  * source flag wasn't set properly for newly added non-text files
  * flavor information is now printed by "conary query" when multiple
    flavors of the same version of a trove are installed
  * "conary repquery --all" flavor output formatting has been improved 

Changes in 0.10.10:
  * changesets get downloaded into a single (meta) file instead of lots
    of separate files
  * fix several bugs in the freshmeat record parsing
  * add a freshmeat project page URL to the metadata by default
  * add a "source" item to metadata
  * the server implementation of troveNames() was horrible
  * enabled file dependencies

Changes in 0.10.9:
  * fixed some authorization issues with the xml-rpc repository interface
  * the web management interface for the repository works now; see
    http://wiki.specifix.com/ConaryConversion for information on how
    to convert existing authdb's to support this
  * fixed a bug with distributed branches
  * users can change their passwords through the repository's web api
  * improved logic apachehooks use to find top level URL
  * fixed bug in server side repository resolution

Changes in 0.10.8:
  * changed iterAllTroves() to troveNames(), which searches a single
    label instead of the whole repository
  * reworked http authentication and CGI request handling and added the
    beginning of a web interface to the repository for user administration
    and metadata management.

Changes in 0.10.7:
  * dependency sql code reworked to use temporary tables
  * new macro called "servicedir" that defines the location for
    service data (%(servicedir)s{ftp,http,etc})
  * added busy wait to sqlite3 python binding when executing SQL
    statements on a busy database

Changes in 0.10.6:
  * Lots of bug fixes for distributed branching
  * Some code rearrangement
  * The start of metadata support code is now included

Changes in 0.10.5:
  * The local database is used for fetching file information (but not
    contents), reducing network traffic when creating change sets
    across repositories.
  * Update works on troves which were locally cooked or emerged
  * Internal changes to move toward getFileContents() working in batches
    rather then on individual files. For now this prevents the repository
    from copying files between the content store and /tmp to serve them.
  * Arch flags are now included in flavors
  * Emerge follows the installLabelPath instead of the buildLabel
  * The extended debugger has been extensively modified
  * Conary can handle filenames with '%' in them
  * The showcs command has been significantly updated, and the updates
    are documented in the conary.1 manpage
  * New syntax for flags distinguishes requirements from "optimized for";
    see http://wiki.specifix.com/FlavorRankSpec

Changes in 0.10.4:
  * Bug fixes for updating from absolute change sets (which basically
    just didn't work for troves which contained config files)
  * Bug fixes for distributed branching
  * The database is used for fetching trove information (but not yet
    file information) when the client constructs change sets across
    distributed branches
  * various other bug fixes

Changes in 0.10.3:
  * this version introduces changes to the network protocol for
    obtaining file contents and changeset generation. The client
    protocol version number has increased, so version 0.10.3 can only
    communicate with servers running the server from 0.10.3. The
    server remains backward compatible with older clients.
  * a warning message is now displayed when the user attempts to
    create a branch that already exists on a trove.
  * the correct trove names are displayed when automatically resolving
    dependencies 
  * packages no longer get the union of all the dependency information
    of the components they contain.  This information would have to be
    recalculated if a user installed a package then removed a
    component afterward.
  * a package policy check was added to reject any world-writable
    executable file.
  * r.TagSpec('tagname', exceptions='filter') now overrides a match by
    another r.TagSpec('tagname', 'filter')
  * more changes to metadata interface
  * various other bug fixes and improvements

Changes in 0.10.2:
  * the repository code is now included in the main conary source
    archive
  * "conary showchangeset" produces a more user-friendly output
  * large responses from the repository server are now compressed
  * the protocol for getFileContents() changed to take a fileId
    instead of the file's path.  The repository code can still handle
    old requests, but the client code now requires the latest
    repository code.
  * bug fixes

Changes in 0.10.1:
  * when applying a changeset, dependency failures are resolved by
    querying servers in the installLabelPath
  * troves that satisfy a dependency can automatically be added to a
    transaction.  This behavior is controlled by the "autoResolve"
    variable in conaryrc or the "--resolve" command line option to
    "conary update"
  * dependency resolution is calculated recursively.  To limit the
    recursion depth to check only first order dependencies, a
    "--no-deps-recurse" option has been added to "conary update"
  * "conary repquery" now takes a "--deps" argument, which prints the
    Requires and Provides information for the trove that is being
    queried.
  * changes have been made to the build side of Conary to facilitate
    building recipes that use cross compilers
  * symlinks now get the appropriate ownership set when they are
    restored
  * groups can now specify which flavor of a trove to include
  * repository queries that don't need file information no longer ask
    the repository for files.
  * various bug fixes and cleanups

Changes in 0.10.0:
  * dependency checking is now performed before changesets are
    applied.  This uses new tables in the local system's database.
    If you are using a database created by a version of Conary older
    than 0.10.0, it must be converted before it can be used.  See:
      http://wiki.specifix.com/ConaryConversion
    for details
  * Shared library dependency information in changesets is now stored
    in a different format.  This means that repositories that use old
    versions of Conary will be unable to give valid changesets to
    Conary 0.10.0 or later.  Therefore, the protocol version number has
    been increased. 
  * --no-deps argument added
  * "cvc co" is now a synonym for "cvc checkout"

Changes in 0.9.6:
  * dependency enforcement infrastructure has been added (the code is
    currently disabled)
  * bug fixes 
    * applying a changeset that un-hardlinks files now works
    * conary rq [trove] --info now works
    * running "conary update [trove]" when more than one flavor of
      [trove] exists no longer tracebacks.  It installs both flavors
      of the trove (which is not always the desired behavior - this
      will be addressed later)
    * only files with execute permissions are checked for
      #!interpreter.
    * "conary rq [trove] --ls" no longer tracebacks when [trove]
      exists in more than one repository
    * various code cleanups

Changes in 0.9.5:
  * new methods for specifying dependency information in recipes have
    been added
  * #! interpreters get added as dependencies
  * local flag overrides now work
  * cvc cook --resume can be used multiple times
  * conary invokes gpg with --no-options to avoid creating or using
    ~/.gnupg

Changes in 0.9.4:
  * fixes to cvc annotate
  * flavors and dependency generation code has been refactored to be
    policy based
  * better error handling when invalid changeset files are given to
    conary
  * minor code cleanups

Changes in 0.9.3:
  * New "cvc annotate" feature
  * Man page updates
  * Changesets which remove a file and replace it now apply correctly.
  * "cvc update" no longer complains and fails to update the CONARY
    state file properly  when ownerships differ
  * FileId generation now looks for previous versions of all the
    packages that have just been created, not just the name of the
    recipe.
  * Cooking as root is no longer allowed
  * Miscellaneous bug fixes.  

Changes in 0.9.2:
 * Bug fixes:
   * Applying changesets that have more than one hard link groups
     sharing the same contents sha1 works now.
 * Build changes:
   * Recipes can now create new top level packages.

Changes in 0.9.1:
 * Bug fixes:
   * Applying a changeset that has a flavor which is a superset of the
     previous version's flavor now works.
   * Parsing optional arguments to command line parameters that appear as
     the last thing on the command line works
 * Build changes:
   * Package policy now checks to ensure that files in /etc/cron.*/*
     are executable
 * Update changes:
   * Conary no longer complains if a transient file has been modified
     on disk but no longer exists in a new version of a component.
 * Miscellaneous changes:
   * Version 1 on-disk changeset file support has been removed.

Changes in 0.9.0:
 * protocol versioning is much more granular now allowing for backwards
   compatible versions of functions
 * changeset command now generates changesets for multiple troves spread
   across multiple repositories
 * change sets are transferred as a set of independent change sets now
   (laying the groundwork for repository change set caching, with which
   this version will work just fine)

Changes in 0.8.3:
 * Man page updates.
 * The "conary query" command now accepts multiple arguments for
   troves and paths
 * Fixed "conary erase" command which was broken in 0.8.2

Changes in 0.8.2:
 * You can now install multiple troves at once (even a combination of
   changeset files and troves from repositories), and the entire
   action is recorded in a single rollback (this required a change in
   command-line arguments for updating troves). 
 * The beginnings of support for searching multiple repositories 
 * Miscellaneous code cleanup and bug fixes.

Changes in 0.8.1:
 * The source code has been re-arranged for easier maintenance, and
   conary has been split into two programs: conary and cvc.
 * Better error messages and debugging tracebacks

Changes in 0.8.0:
 * A new changeset format supports hard links but requires staged update.
 * The new changeset format also collapses duplicate contents even
   when hardlinks are not used.
 * By default, rc?.d/{K,S}* symlinks are no longer packaged. The
   chkconfig program is relied on to create them at package
   install/update time. Init scripts are explicitly required to
   support the chkconfig protocol by default
 * Improved error messages
 * Several bug fixes.

Changes in 0.7.7:
 * Extended debugger saves and emails
 * Tracebacks now include arguments and locals
 * More size optimizations were made when applying changesets
 * Applying absolute changesets when a trove is already installed is
   now much more efficient than it was
 * Self-referential symlinks raise a packaging exception.
 * Several bugs fixes.

Changes in 0.7.6:
 * Installation
   * Hardlink handling
   * enhanced debugging capabilities (including saving a debugging
     state file to enable remote debugging)

   * using binary file ids and iterators for significant memory savings
   * and runtime support for the x86.x86_64 sub-architecture
 * Cooking
   * more robust handling of the --resume option
   * policy normalization of where app-defaults files go.

Changes in 0.7.5:
 * Hard links are implemented (but not yet enabled, in order to
   preserve changeset compatibility for now).
 * Several bugs have been fixed for installing and cooking.

Changes in 0.7.4:
 * Fileids are now stored and transmitted in binary rather than
   encoded.
 * Better handling of multiple versions of packages/troves installed
   at the same time
 * Missing file handling improvements
 * Recipe inheritance is now possible between repositories
 * Enhanced Interrupted builds
 * The dynamic tag protocol was slightly modified
 * Added Arch.x86.amd64 and Arch.x86.em64t
 * several bugs fixes

Changes in 0.7.0:
 * sqlite3 is used for the database
 * better handling of multiple packages with the same name installed at once.

Changes in 0.6.6:
 * repository protocol update
 * changeset format update
 * added the ability to resume halted local builds
 * added the ability to easily package build-time tests to run at
   install time to qualify new/changed environments
 * better handling of packaged .pyc/.pyo files
 * better shared library handling
 * improved inline documentation
 * optimizations for both space and time
 * numerous bugfixes
