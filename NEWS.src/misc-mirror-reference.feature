Added a "reference" section to mirror script configuration. If provided, this repository will be used to determine what troves are to be mirrored, but the content will be downloaded from the "source" repository. This allows mirroring only the troves visible on an external mirror while using a closer copy of the repository that might have more troves than desired.
