Promoting redirect troves now rewrites versions in redirects when
the target of the redirect has been promoted according to the
promote map, and leaves other redirects untouched.   Previously,
it converted the redirect into a redirect to nothing.
Additionally, a script called "promote-redirects" has been added
to automate the process of finding and promoting redirect packages
between labels.
