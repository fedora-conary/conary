    <shortDesc>A distributed software management system.</shortDesc>
    <longDesc>Conary is a distributed software management system
for Linux distributions. It replaces traditional
package management solutions (such as RPM and
dpkg) with one designed to enable loose
collaboration across the Internet. It enables sets
of distributed and loosely connected repositories
to define the components which are installed on a
Linux system. Rather than having a full
distribution come from a single vendor, it allows
administrators and developers to branch a
distribution, keeping the pieces which fit their
environment while grabbing components from other
repositories across the Internet.</longDesc>
