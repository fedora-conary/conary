- provide generic interface for start_transaction=False for sqlite
  (and only sqlite has this issue, so maybe fixing the bindings would
   be a better way)
- implement cu = db.prepare(sql)
- table TroveInfo has a "data" column that is of type BINARY. In MySQL
  we have BLOB, MEDIUMBLOB and LARGEBLOB types. BLOB is upto
  65,535. Migration of the data column to a MEDIUMBLOB type (16M max in
  size) can have a negative impact on performance and storage
  parameters.
