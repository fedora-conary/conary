Overview:

This is an extension module for the SQLite embedded relational database. It
tries to conform to the Python DB-API Spec v2 as far as possible. One problem
is that SQLite returns everything as text. This is a result of SQLite's
internal representation of data, however it still may be possible to return
data in the type specified by the table definitions. I am still working on
that, and will require some study of the SQLite source.

Installation:

Installation should be relatively simple. Following that prescribed by Python,
it can be done in two steps:

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

For building PySQLite on Windows, check out the file INSTALL.win32.

Other:

Check out the doc/rest and examples folders.
