# GNOME programs tend to need their menu help to function without apparant
# error, so it needs to be either in 'runtime' or 'data'.  It would otherwise
# show up in locale.  Most other systems include the default locale within
# the application, and need locale data only for translations.  This is
# therefore encoded as an exception to the general rule.
